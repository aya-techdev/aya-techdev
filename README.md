## Hi there 👋

I’m Aya , a curious and ambitious Systems Engineering student specializing in IMSI (yeah, it’s a mouthful 🤓). 
I’m on a mission to become a web developer, but honestly, I’m open to pretty much all things tech — from coding magic to everything digital and beyond!

## What I’m up to 🎯

- Learning web development
- already familiar with c ( basics matter !🤥)
- Exploring programming languages 
- Diving into algorithms and problem-solving (because who doesn’t love a good brain teaser?)  

## Current Projects 🚧

- Playing around with some fun coding projects (think of me as a coding apprentice 🧙‍♀️)  
- Trying out different web dev ideas — sometimes it works, sometimes it’s a beautiful mess! 🎨💥  
- Always curious and excited to learn new tech and tools (beginner level, but with superhero enthusiasm!) 🚀 

## What I want to be when I grow up 🌱

A badass coder who can handle any challenge, contribute to open-source projects, and maybe even work freelance while sipping coffee at a cozy café ☕️💻
